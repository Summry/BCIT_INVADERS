# Project Title
BCIT Invaders

# Project Description

Reinvent the the famous Japanese shooting video game released in 1978 in Taito, Space Invaders with a twist! This twist will include BCIT elements as we are students of the Computer Information Technology program. Our reinvented game is called BCIT Invaders. Typically it's a fixed shooter in which the player moves a laser cannon horizaontally across the bottom of the screen and fires at aliens overhead. Instead the invaders are Ben Yu and books! The player must keep BCIT alive and face off the ruthless books and one-too-many Ben Yu.
