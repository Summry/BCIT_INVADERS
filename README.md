# Project Title
BCIT Invaders

# Project Description

Reinvent the the famous Japanese shooting video game released in 1978 in Taito, Space Invaders with a twist! This twist will include BCIT elements as we are students of the Computer Information Technology program. Our reinvented game is called BCIT Invaders. Typically it's a fixed shooter in which the player moves a laser cannon horizaontally across the bottom of the screen and fires at aliens overhead. Instead we will shoot, books and assignments at BCIT Instructors in our program!
